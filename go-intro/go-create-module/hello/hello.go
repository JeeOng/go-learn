/* 
In this code, you:

Declare a main package. In Go, code executed as an application must be in a main package.
Import two packages: example.com/greetings and the fmt package. This gives your code access 
to functions in those packages. Importing example.com/greetings (the package contained in 
the module you created earlier) gives you access to the Hello function. You also import 
fmt, with functions for handling input and output text (such as printing text to the console).
Get a greeting by calling the greetings package's Hello function.
